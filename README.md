# BikeStore
BikeStore SQL Project is developed in Microsoft SQL Server to simulate a retail data workflow. It imports sales data from CSV files into staging tables, transforms and loads it into structured tables using MERGE, and generates reports through views and stored procedures. The project focuses on sales, customers, products,  and KPI analysis.
