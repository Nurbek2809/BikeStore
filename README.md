About the Project

This project is developed in SQL Server for the BikeStore retail system. The main goal is to import sales data from CSV files into the database and generate various reports and performance metrics based on that data.
The database covers sales, products, inventory, staff, and customers.

How the System Works

First, CSV files are loaded into staging tables. Then the data is cleaned and written into the main tables using MERGE statements. This allows existing records to be updated and new records to be inserted.
After the data is stored, reports are generated using views, and KPIs are calculated through stored procedures. Some processes run automatically, and their results are saved in a log table.

Views

The project includes reporting views such as:

vw_StoreSalesSummary – Revenue, number of orders, and average order value per store

vw_TopSellingProducts – Best-selling products

vw_InventoryStatus – Products with low stock

vw_StaffPerformance – Orders handled and revenue generated by staff

vw_RegionalTrends – Sales by city and state

vw_SalesByCategory – Sales and estimated profit by category

vw_TotalRevenue – Total revenue

vw_SalesByBrand – Sales by brand

vw_StoreInventoryAllProducts – Inventory status of all products per store

vw_Top20StockShare – Inventory share of the top 20 key products

vw_CustomerRetentionCounts – One-time vs returning customers
